##Reflection 

This project took some time, some trial and error lot's of googling again.Even though the logic was mostly done converting it to jsx with typescript was not easy. So it ended up being hours of step by step on google. How do you do this? and That and that? and so on. Very long and draw out but soon patterns started to emerge. The process is easy to understand but the implemetation was tedious at times. I refered a lot to past projects and the lesson notes as well. 

Overall I am happy with it, it all flows well, I hit a few snags with the typescript adn also with connecteing the proper country name vs the ID which cause some issies but ultimately I go it working well.
